					I am <span className='--bold'>Vy Phan</span>, a freelance illustrator and
					graphic designer based in Massachusetts. I grew up in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
					and embarked on a transformative journey when I began studying abroad in the
					United States in 2018.
					<br />
					<br />
					My passion for designing and drawing ignited during my early school years and
					has continued to burn brightly ever since. Starting in Grade 4, I took it upon
					myself to master the intricacies of Adobe Creative Suite, using this knowledge
					to create basic graphics and posters centered around Kpop idols. This
					independent pursuit allowed me to cultivate my artistic abilities and lay the
					foundation for my professional growth.
					<br />
					<br />
					In my spare time, I find great joy in the art of dance. During my summer breaks
					in Vietnam, I actively participate in{' '}
					<span className='--bold'>B-Wild Official</span> - one of the most famous
					national dance teams with over 850k Subscribers on{' '}
					<a className='txt-link' href='https://www.youtube.com/@BWildOfficial'>
						YouTube
					</a>
					. I also joined their Content Creators Team for the{' '}
					<a href='https://www.tiktok.com/@bwild.official' className='txt-link'>
						TikTok Channel
					</a>{' '}
					with more than 350k Subscribers.
					<br />
					<br />
					While creating illustrations and working on projects, I enjoy cuddling my cat,
					Mèo. These moments fuel my inspiration and bring tranquility to my creative
					process.
